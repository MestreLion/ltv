Properly integrate and/or document /unrar/install.py:
- setup.py might trigger the build, consider as package data and move to package?
- rarcompat.py could look into /unrar/ for the library instead or in addition to /legendastv
- /unrar/install.py could copy built files to /legendastv
- Maybe the all above options should use system.save_data_path() instead?
- Delete /unrar/install.sh, it's redundant and not as complete as /unrar/install.py
- Rename /unrar/install.py to /unrar/install ?
- /unrar/README.md should definately mention /unrar/install.py and the way to integrate
- For those reading this, the current status is:
    - Run /unrar/install.py to generate your platform-specific libs at /unrar/
    - Move/Copy those libs to /legendastv, rarcompat.py will use it as last fallback option
